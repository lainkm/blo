TODO:
=====

Use Postgres database provided by Heroku instead of SQLite.
-----------------------------------------------------------

SQLite database needs files to keep data. It sames normal if i just publish an article by my script `publish.py`, and it will show on my website. But if i restart my app on the Heroku, all articles i published just now will disappear.

The reason is that the script updates the database, whose files are stored in some dyno. This means that you can post new articles as long as you do not perform dyno-related operations like deploying (pushing to the remote branch) or restarting.

So SQLite is more suitable for debugging. To avoid this situation you might want to store the database files somewhere else, but running other databases is a better approach.

I need to repair it as soon as possible.

Another way to publish my article
---------------------------------

Using the script to publish article is so inconvenient that i can't write articles whenever i want.And i also don't want to write user authentication and user login handing.So...

Modify the interface
--------------------

For reading more easily on my phone:)

Elegance:)

Do a better one by Django
-------------------------

yeah.

Write more articles to enrich my site.
--------------------------------------

I used CSDN to record the study for just two month. But most of the time, i wrote my articles on Evernote. So many things written down by me. So i hope i can continue:)

New schedule
------------

I NEED TO READ DOC AND LEARN THINGS FASTER. 

ALL PLAN SHOULD BE COMPLETED!

OH, AND ENGLISH WORDS!
